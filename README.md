I'm **Mike San RomÃ¡n**.

I'm the Director of Engineering, Platform & Technology at [Buffer](https://buffer.com), and co-founder of [otter.es](https://otter.es) and [carpeta.app](https://www.carpeta.app/?utm_source=github).

My over 10-years of experience building software in both startup and agency environments, combined with a focus on business goals through my experience as an entrepreneur, led me to dive deep into best practices to build lean software that adapts to change and brings value both to the organization and its customers.

I aim now to share and build those processes and skillsets on developers and teams through mentoring and leadership.
